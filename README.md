# Pregnancy Chatbot

Kilkari is a pregnancy information service designed to deliver pre-recorded, stage-specific audio and video messages to pregnant women and mothers with children under the age of 1 year.

This repository contains the development and design process for an LLM-based chatbot to answer queries about pregnancy and infant care. The chatbot is currently in the early stages of development.
